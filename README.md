# Lending Club Case Study
> Given Data Set for loan applicants which contains data about whether they ‘defaulted’ or not, our aim is to determine what all factors affect the loan defaulting.
Any Loan can either be accpeted or rejected. If it is accepted then there are three possibilities. First being it is fully paid, Second being it is in current payment process, and third being it has been Charged Off, meaning applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan. Our Aim is to identify what all factors affect the third case.

## General Information
- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- Understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understanding how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers is very crucial.
- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- The dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011 for the company.
